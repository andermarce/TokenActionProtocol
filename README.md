# Simple Summary
Health alternative for crypto ecosystem. Transition from utility tokens to action tokens.
# Abstract
Not ready
# Motivation
Almost anything ethereum tokens is utility and you as investor do not have any rights on company profits, 
it is profitable for business, but not profitable for us.
But if we could be possible to change it now, in cryptocurrency technologies age. 
I see no reason for us to make the crowdsalers pay us a legitimate income.
