# Simple Summary
Health alternative for crypto ecosystem. Transition from utility tokens to action tokens.
# Abstract
Not ready
# Motivation
Almost anything ethereum tokens is utility and you as investor do not have any rights on company profits,
it is profitable for business, but not profitable for us.
But if we could be possible to change it now, in cryptocurrency technologies age.
I see no reason for us to make the crowdsalers pay us a legitimate income.
# Specification

##### Consensus

1) At the first stage, we determine the owner of the token, and only the true owner, can create a contract wrapper TAP.
For this purpose, the contract is ConfrimOwnership.

2) Second, the owner receives all shares in the amount of totalsupply from EPC 20 token.

3) Third, the distribution of shares occurs at the will of the creator.

4) Fourth, the restriction on the transfer of rights, requires that the recipient on the account have more or equivalent balance in relation to the ERC20 balance. Those. the recipient must have an equivalent balance in order to prove that he, at least at the moment of receipt, is the real holder of the asset.

5) The fifth. The recalculation of the David takes place at a predetermined time limit, and when the legal balance is changed, the recalculation and accrual of the Devian occurs, under the conditions specified in the contract.

6) The sixth. The outputs are output through the withdraw pattern, the withdraw function.

##### TAP interface
